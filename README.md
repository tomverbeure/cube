# LED Cube with Cisco Controller and Pixel Purse LED Panels

This repo needs a bit of cleanup for general public consumption,
but it had all the assets for my LED cube thatâ€™s built from
[Project MC2 Pixel Purse LED panels](https://tomverbeure.github.io/2019/10/03/Pixel-Purse.html) 
and a [Cisco HWIC-3G-CDMA modem](https://tomverbeure.github.io/2019/11/11/Cisco-HWIC-3G-CDMA.html).

I gave a talk about this project at BangBangCon West 2020: here are
the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tBU5-lJYmU) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FYmVh-brx6SpZoJmzuIXrNegWdtriQ9k38EbrvDupg8) of the talk.

I also wrote a [blog post](https://tomverbeure.github.io/2021/05/16/Pixel-Purse-LED-Cube.html)
about this project.
